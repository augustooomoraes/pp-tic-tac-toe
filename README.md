## Portfolio project: Tic Tac Toe

This app was first made in **vanilla Javascript**. It was then refactored to **Typescript** and, after that, to **React**. This was all made following [**Zach Gollwitzer**'s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsnQ5uepIaE) on **freeCodeCamp**'s YouTube channel.

I am once again refactoring it â€“ to a **Next.js** app.

```
npx create-next-app@latest
- with TypeScript
- without ESLint
- with Tailwind CSS
- without `src/` directory
- with App Router
- without customizing the default import alias

npm i classnames
npm i react-icons
npm i lodash
npm i @types/lodash
```

Besides web projects, there you can find other kinds of works I've been doing:

- graphical design
- editorial design
- 3D modeling / sculpting / rendering / animation
